Scratch 2

Want
    Writing extension files
        could provide a downlaod link on custom webpage of extension
    Reading extension files
        could read extension files from external resources instead of only files (e.g. http:// resources)



** For python 2 and 3 support, could use a compat file like requests.py

Questions:
    do blocks need unique names (operation/remote variable names)?
        it doesn't seem like it. two exactly the same blocks are 
    figure out how default params are matched up for blocks

Scratch notes:
    Blocks/block names are not unique. You can have two of exactly the same blocks
    Extension names are unique. importing an extension with same name and different blocks or port numbers will update the already imported extension



Routes: (Note: all free-form strings should be URL encoded)
    /poll - retrieve sensor values and status info
    /reset_all - sent when stop button is clicked; should rest hardware to its power-up state
    /crossdomain.xml - return a null-terminated policy file
    /<command>/<arg1>/<arg2>/... - command with optional args
    /<command>/<command_id>/<arg1>/<arg2>/... - wait command with optional args
